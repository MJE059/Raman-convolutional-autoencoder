# Raman-convolutional-autoencoder
This is the source code for a variational autoencoder aimed at Raman spectra of biological nanoparticles. The autoencoder is enabled for explicit consideration of both the spectra and the wavenumber shift vector associated with the spectra
#Usage
The file "CVAE.py" describes the autoencoder as a class "Raman_CVAE()", see comments in code for use
The file "Classifyer.py" describes the classifier block that connects to the latent space of the autoencoder, see comments in code for use
